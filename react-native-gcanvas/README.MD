`@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas` is a C++ native canvas 2D/WebGL component based on gpu opengl glsl shader [GCanvas](https://alibaba.github.io/GCanvas/) which is a lightweight cross-platform graphics rendering engine for mobile devices developed by Alibaba. It is written with C++ based on OpenGL ES, so it can provide high performance 2D/WebGL rendering capabilities for JavaScript runtime. It also has browser-like canvas APIs, so it's very convenient and flexiable for use, especially for web developers.

Supported operating systems are Android 4.1+ (API 16) and iOS 9.0+.

Since Alibaba [feat: delete weex bridge & reactive bridge](https://github.com/alibaba/GCanvas/commit/1bbee40a16c0c5da58698e2892ba33f836eedb70), here comes this `@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas` package.

## Performance Test Result

### `setState` vs `canvas` On react-native-web
With 200 circles backgroundColor generate (1 `ms`) and render continually, the render `ms` and final `fps` with Chrome Performance on Windows:

    setState  80 ms        means 12 fps  (stuck for human eyes)
    canvas    1.5 ms       means 400 fps (smooth for human eyes)

### `setNativeProps` vs `expo-2d-context` vs `react-native-gcanvas` On react-native
With 800 circles backgroundColor generate and render continually, the final UI `fps` and JS `fps` with react-native developer menu Perf Monitor on an old `Huawei Honor 6 Play` smartphone released in 2017 (Mediatek MT6737T 1.4 GHz, 2 GB RAM, Android 6):

    setNativeProps        UI: 20 fps       JS: 1 fps  (stuck for human eyes)
    expo-2d-context       UI: 56 fps       JS: 1 fps  (stuck for human eyes)
    react-native-gcanvas  UI: 56 fps       JS: 20 fps (smooth for human eyes)

On an old iPhone 7:

With 800 circles backgroundColor generate and render continually

    setNativeProps        UI: 60 fps       JS: 15 fps (smooth for human eyes)
    react-native-gcanvas  UI: 20 fps       JS: 59 fps (stuck for human eyes)
    react-native-gcanvas in release mode              (smooth for human eyes)

With 1400 circles backgroundColor generate and render continually

    setNativeProps        UI: 59 fps       JS: 7 fps  (smooth for human eyes)
    react-native-gcanvas  UI: 10 fps       JS: 58 fps (stuck for human eyes)
    react-native-gcanvas in release mode              (smooth for human eyes)


## Convenient With Browser-like canvas APIs
[gl-react](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/pixeleditor?menu=true) maybe can deal with the performance problem, but it need developer directly code with GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), and there is no way to let many React components developed by browser-like canvas APIs be easily ported to React Native.

[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) maybe can deal with the performance problem, but [memory leak when meshes update](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/issues/263), [Leaking WebGLRenderer and more when unmounting](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/issues/514), [Suggestion: Dispose of renderer context when canvas is destroyed?](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/issues/132), and there is no way to let many React components developed by browser-like canvas APIs be easily ported to React Native.

[expo-2d-context](https://github.com/expo/expo-2d-context) can let many React components developed by browser-like canvas APIs be easily ported to React Native, but it need ctx.flush() that not belongs to canvas 2d APIs, and it's performance is too low.

Ref to [Experiments with High Performance Animation in React Native](https://engineering.salesforce.com/experiments-with-high-performance-animation-in-react-native-80a0cb7052b0), it use many ways include `setNativeProps` and [React Native NanoVG](https://github.com/robclouth/react-native-art-nanovg). Maybe `nanovg` can deal with the performance problem, but for now (2020.12) there is no React Native canvas component using  `nanovg` to let many React components developed by browser-like canvas APIs be easily ported to React Native.

So for now (2020.12), `@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas` is the best choice.

### canvas projects ported from React to React Native
* [react-native-particles-bg](https://github.com/flyskywhy/react-native-particles-bg) just ported one file to [Support react-native](https://github.com/flyskywhy/react-native-particles-bg/commit/637ab13) from [particles-bg](https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg) which based on [Proton](https://github.com/drawcall/Proton). You can also compare it with [react-native-particles-webgl](https://github.com/flyskywhy/react-native-particles-webgl) which based on memory leaking [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). Here is a result in my APP PlayLights.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas/master/assets/PlayLightsAbout.gif" width="480">

* [zdog](https://github.com/metafizzy/zdog) actually no need modify any code of itself as described in [@flyskywhy/react-native-browser-polyfill](https://github.com/flyskywhy/react-native-browser-polyfill), and here is a result.

## Getting Started
### react-native
Only support RN >= `0.62` as described in [android/gcanvas_library/build.gradle](android/gcanvas_library/build.gradle)

    npm install @flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas --save

#### Android
Add below into `/android/settings.gradle`
```
include ':android:gcanvas_library'
project(':android:gcanvas_library').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas/android/gcanvas_library')
include ':android:bridge_spec'
project(':android:bridge_spec').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas/android/bridge_spec')
include ':android:adapters:gcanvas_imageloader_fresco'
project(':android:adapters:gcanvas_imageloader_fresco').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas/android/adapters/gcanvas_imageloader_fresco')
include ':android:adapters:bridge_adapter'
project(':android:adapters:bridge_adapter').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas/android/adapters/bridge_adapter')
```

Add below into `/react-native.config.js`
```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  dependencies: {
    '@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas': {
      platforms: {
        android: {
          packageImportPath: 'import com.taobao.gcanvas.bridges.rn.GReactPackage;',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Sometimes will meet compile error `java.io.FileNotFoundException: SOME_PATH/.cxx/cmake/SOME_PATH/android_gradle_build.json (The system cannot find the file specified)` after upgrade this pacakge by `npm install`, can solve it by [add ` --rerun-tasks` to your gradlew command](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68126063/6318705) once like

    ./android/gradlew assembleDebug --rerun-tasks -p ./android/

#### iOS

Add below into `/ios/Podfile`
```
  pod "GCanvas", :path => "../node_modules/@flyskywhy/react-native-gcanvas/GCanvas.podspec"
```
    cd YOUR_PROJECT/ios
    pod install

#### Web
When I use react-native-web, I also use react-app-rewired as described in my blog:

* CN [安装 react-native-web 并配以 react-app-rewired](https://github.com/flyskywhy/g/blob/master/i%E4%B8%BB%E8%A7%82%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%93%E9%AA%8C%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F/t%E5%BF%AB%E4%B9%90%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%93%E9%AA%8C/%E7%94%B5%E4%BF%A1/Tool/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80/JavaScript/React%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3.md#rn--060-%E7%9A%84%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85-react-native-web)

* EN [Install react-native-web with react-app-rewired](https://github.com/reactrondev/react-native-web-swiper/issues/41#issuecomment-685207381)

With react-app-rewired, my react-native-web@0.15.0 and RN 0.63+ without expo project works fine, you can try it.


## Example As Usage
### 3D webgl
3D webgl examples see [webgl_demo](webgl_demo).

`gl.UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL` is not support in [webgl_demo/texture.js](webgl_demo/texture.js), and will not be supported ref to [y-orientation for texImage2D from HTML elements](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/public-mailing-list/public_webgl/1212/msg00022.php).

Here is the result of [webgl_demo/cube.js](webgl_demo/cube.js).

## Introduction

See the [Introduction to GCanvas](https://alibaba.github.io/GCanvas/docs/Developer's%20Guide.html) for a detailed introduction to GCanvas.

### Weex
Follow [Weex Setup Guide](https://alibaba.github.io/GCanvas/docs/Integrate%20GCanvas%20on%20Weex.html) to integrate GCanvas on Weex.

### JavaScript
GCanvas has browser-like canvas APIs, so almost all of the APIs are exactly same as HTML5 canvas. At this moment, we have already supported 90% of 2D APIs and 99% of WebGL APIs. You can find out those informations in [2D APIs](https://alibaba.github.io/GCanvas/docs/Graphics%202D.html) and [WebGL APIs](https://alibaba.github.io/GCanvas/docs/WebGL.html).
